# JS2Grupp9
Repository f√∂r grupp 9:s gruppuppgift i Javascript 2.

This is a school project by Group 9, which consists of Frank Asplund, Tove Brandt, Lina Andersson, and Daniel Bladh Stenberg.

The task was to create a webshop with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a cart, a productsite, and database.
The site is an SPA, and we used bootstrap for some parts.
